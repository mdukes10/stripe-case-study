Case Study Proposal Stripe
What Is It
Stripe provides plug-and-play API’s to manage the (rather complex) processing of making and receiving payments on a website, most notably via credit card. Stripe’s API’s support refunds, fraud prevention, recurring payments, and various monitoring tools. It has branched out to support in-person payments, the issuance of proprietary payment cards. It even provides a turn-key solution for setting up an internet business.
Why This Matters
The core of internet commerce is the ability of a website to securely accept payments over the web, which leads naturally to the ancillary services listed above.
Why This May Be Interesting
One may want to set up credit card processing on websites, either for themselves or others. This may prompt them to become familiar with related web technologies, since that’s how Stripe API’s are implemented.
One may like to know what is involved in electronic funds transfer, as it is one of the core activities of fintech. This includes the establishment of the banking arrangements required to accept payments.
Stripe’s website claims that one significant barrier to the growth of e-commerce is the shortage of engineering talent.
